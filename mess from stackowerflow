Hi there!
I think your problem is in MainViewModel.kt in #13 line.
You use viewModelScope.launch { ... } - this is not a scope for background process. This is a scope of ViewModel-object living time to hold your data in VM
You should use 

CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).launch { ... }

This is real background process than is needed for web-communications
